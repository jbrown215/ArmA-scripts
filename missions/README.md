# Missions

These are some of the missions we've designed using our scripts.

## Dark Ivan 3B

Mission was to link up with POWs who were captured in Dark Ivan 3A. POWs started off
in a jail with several locked doors that required a key to unlock.

Uses `keyUnlocksDoor.sqf` and `personUnlocksDoor.sqf`.
